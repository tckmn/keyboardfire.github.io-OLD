*Once upon a time...*

In the land of the [PPCG](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com), there was once a seemingly innocent tag. This tag was called [code-trolling]. The tag was very popular in the Stack Exchange network, and questions tagged with it recieved tens or even hundreds of answers and upvotes. The site's response was to viciously kill the tag with fire.

Does this seem a bit backwards or wrong to you? **It's not**, and here's why.

Let's imagine this new website I'm making, called "LlamaLand." It's a website where you can ask and answer questions about llamas. In the beginning, it's very nice and looks like this:

    [1 answer]   Why is my llama turning purple? - 15 mins ago
    [4 answers]  What should I spray on llama food in order to avoid it being stolen by an alpaca? - 2 hours ago
    [2 answers]  Are blue llama food pellets or green grass bundles better for llama health? - 3 hours ago

Now, let's say someone arrives at the site, and decides they want to post something. But they don't really have anything to post. So they just post something like this:

    [0 answers]  What's your favorite method of petting a llama? - 3 secs ago
    [2 answers]  Why is my llama turning purple? - 35 mins ago
    [6 answers]  What should I spray on llama food in order to avoid it being stolen by an alpaca? - 2 hours ago
    [5 answers]  Are blue llama food pellets or green grass bundles better for llama health? - 3 hours ago

Without enforcing question quality and taking action on that question, which I'll get to in a second, pretty soon it'll look like this:

    [19 answers] What's your favorite method of petting a llama? - 6 mins ago
    [2 answers]  Why is my llama turning purple? - 41 mins ago
    [6 answers]  What should I spray on llama food in order to avoid it being stolen by an alpaca? - 2 hours ago
    [5 answers]  Are blue llama food pellets or green grass bundles better for llama health? - 4 hours ago
And then pretty soon that will escalate into this:

    [18 answers] What should I name my new llama? - 1 min ago
    [31 answers] What is the best thing to do with a new llama you just got? - 4 mins ago
    [28 answers] Favorite brand of llama food? - 4 mins ago
    [50 answers] What's your favorite llama-related topic? - 6 mins ago

So, what have you learned from this strange LlamaLand escapade?

> We like those posts, because they're popular! And they bring more traffic to the site!

Those posts may be popular, but ultimately, they're **detrimental to the health of the site**. If the situation on the hypothetical llama site is left unchecked, maybe people will even start asking about alpacas, and then animals, and then pigs, and then bacon, and then pretty soon the site will be filled with posts about waffles instead of llamas!

> But does that matter, as long as the topic is kept limited to llamas?

**Yes**. If question quality is not enforced, questions will stop being questions. There will be polls, and overly broad posts that ask people for just their personal opinions, and "questions" just for the sake of posting something. The entire purpose of the site, which is to pose questions and receive specific answers, will be destroyed.

> ... and what's wrong with that? I like answering polls!

Then *go post your polls on some other site!* My general point here is that if the scope of any website or question and answer zone is not kept narrow enough, it will disappear entirely.

> But people can still post their llama questions if they want, and ignore these "poll" or "big list" questions. Just because someone else is doing something doesn't mean other people are forced to join in, right?

Okay, let me put it this way. We have one place, dedicated to, say, ducks (I don't know; I'm just making this up on the spot). Now let's say that people start posting questions about llamas, and... about potatoes, and pancakes, and, um, and... lightbulbs, and who knows what else. By this logic, this is okay, because everyone else can just ignore these questions, right? So now we have a site dedicated to answering *all questions that exist*, which is obviously impossible (okay, maybe possible, but then it becomes a wasteland like [The Site That Shall Not Be Named](http://answers.yahoo.com/)). And then the original basis of the reason the site was created doesn't even exist any more (needless to say), and your site is ruined.

So, is popularity good? Sometimes. But you can't use the "but it's popular!" argument when you *know* it's lowering the quality of your site.
