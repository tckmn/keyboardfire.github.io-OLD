So I've gotten [pretty far](https://github.com/KeyboardFire/ludum-dare-30/commit/b0b0d18e32a874951f945267618ada085f1c7356#diff-d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e) with my game so far, at least to me. But there's still one problem: How is this *remotely* related to Connected Worlds, the theme?

Well, my plan was that once the hero completes the water level, he/she advances to an earth level, then air, and finally the final boss level, fire (you know, underworld and all that). Kind of like an evolution or something.

But that's clearly not happening - I only have 28 hours left! So I'm just going to cut the earth and air part, and skip straight to fire. I still have the problem that the player is a potato with legs, though... I was going to have him evolve to become less potato-like as he proceeds through the earth and air levels, but I guess he'll be a walking potato or something for the fire level.

Lesson learned: **Don't underestimate how short 48 hours is!**

(Also, I was forced to go watch a movie and do social stuff (what's "social"?), so that may have been a problem. I need to plan ahead next time so I can try not to get forced to do things!)
