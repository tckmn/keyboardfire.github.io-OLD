title: "What's the largest MD5 hash you can find?"

So I had a [completely random idea](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/17168183#17168183) in Stack Exchange chat today, and I decided: why not hack something together?

    llama@llama:~$ echo -n bfgjur | md5sum
    fffffff8f5f236f99b8193cb3d0dd1f5  -

Here's the Python code I used to find this string:

    n = 6
    mmax = 0
    import itertools
    import md5
    for x in itertools.permutations('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n):
    hsh = int(md5.new(''.join(x)).hexdigest(), 16)
    if hsh &gt; mmax:
    mmax = hsh
    print(hsh)
    print(x)

And here's the results for various values of `n`:

    2: rc
    3: gdr
    4: svcy
    5: ktihb
    6: bfgjur

This took about 2 minutes to run on my machine. Can you find a string with a larger hash? A good start would be to include all ASCII characters, and maybe multithread it, and just wait a long time.

Being bored is fun!
