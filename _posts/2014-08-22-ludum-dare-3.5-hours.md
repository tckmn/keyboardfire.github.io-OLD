I'm participating in the [Ludum Dare competition](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/)Â soon; in fact, it's in only three and a half hours! Woohoo!

Ludum Dare is a fun and friendly game development competition that challenges you to create the best game you can (in accordance with a theme) in under 48 hours. You create your own assets (images, audio, etc.) and build your game from scratch (or starting with a game engine), and when the 48 hours are up, anybody can try and play your game. I plan to create mine with JavaScript / HTML5 and post the open source code on Github; more details on [my post on the Ludum Dare site](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2014/08/22/count-me-in-for-my-first-ludum-dare/).

So what am I doing right now? I'm playing around with Audacity (which I will use for sound effects / maybe music) and GIMP (which I will use for images), and I've created some mildly interesting things as practice. Unfortunately, I'll be somewhere else when it starts (8:00 in my timezone), but I will check the theme on my phone there and think of ideas for my game in preparation to code.

This is going to be fun!
